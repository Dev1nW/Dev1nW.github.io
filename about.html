          <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p2>
              I am currently a Research Fellow in the Army Educational Outreach Program (AEOP), pioneering research in Human-Guided Reinforcement Learning and Natural Language Processing. In December of 2023 I received my MS in Artificial Intelligence from The University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA), marking me as one of the trailblazers in the <a href="https://www.utsa.edu/today/2023/12/story/2023-devin-white.html">first cohort</a> of the program. I received my BS in Electrical and Computer Engineering in December of 2021. My research endeavors have led to contributions in the field, most notably my work on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16348">Rating-Based Reinforcement Learning</a>, which was accepted to AAAI 2024 and The Many Facets of Preference-Based Learning workshop at ICML 2023. Additionally, my collaborative research on <a href="https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.2024-2206">Deep Reinforcement Learning-based Optimal Time-constrained Intercept Guidance</a> was accepted to the AIAA SciTech Guidance, Navigation, and Control Conference 2024, further cementing my role in advancing AI technology. Beyond research, my graduate journey at UTSA was highlighted by participating in the <a href="https://www.utsa.edu/today/2023/04/story/draper-data-science-competition-winners.html">inaugural UTSA Draper Data Science Business Plan Competition</a>. Here, I played a pivotal role in the Silent Siren project which won honorable mention and bonus by innovating a solution to enhance safety for deaf and hard-of-hearing drivers. This was done by providing visual cues to the driver when an emergency vehicle siren was detected. My contribution involved developing a cutting-edge iOS application and edge device model, bringing the concept closer to reality.  My undergraduate accolades include receiving the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/devinwhiteai_research-stem-utsa-activity-6871100823104032768-5RUr/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop">Outstanding Undergraduate Award</a> and being a part of a team, SDQ Engineering, which won the <a href="https://www.utsa.edu/today/2021/11/story/tech-symposium-recap.html">UTSA Tech Symposium 2021</a>. Additionally, I participated in the <a href="https://ceid.utsa.edu/reu/activities/">National Science Foundation's Research Experience for Undergraduates</a> program at UTSA, which began my interests in Artificial Intelligence.
