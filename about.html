        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I am a current Masters in Artificial Intelligence student at The University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA). I received my Bachelor's in Electrical and Computer Engineering in the Fall of 2021 from UTSA. In the Summer of 2021, I was a participant in the <a href="https://ceid.utsa.edu/reu/activities/">National Science Foundation, Research Experience for Undergraduates</a> at UTSA, this program is what started my journey into Artificial Intelligence and my interest in Reinforcement Learning. I learned about various Machine Learning topics and worked on a project for Human Guided Reinforcement Learning. Throughout my Undergraduate degree, I had the honor of receiving the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/devinwhiteai_research-stem-utsa-activity-6871100823104032768-5RUr/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop">Outstanding Undergraduate Award</a> in Fall of 2021. In the Fall of 2021 I also worked on an Electrical Engineering team called SDQ Engineering to create a Low Volume Chicken Seasoning Machine Sponsored by HEB this project was a collaboration with a Mechanical Engineering Team called Mechanical Velox. This project was presented at UTSA's Tech Symposium and came <a href="https://www.utsa.edu/today/2021/11/story/tech-symposium-recap.html">first place</a> in the competition. After graduating I took a semester to learn more about Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Reinforcement Learning. I had the opportunity to help teach Undergraduate and Graduate students who were new to Machine Learning about what Machine Learning is and how to write Machine Learning code. I also created learning materials for students in my lab to learn Python, Machine Learning, Neural Networks, and Reinforcement Learning, these provided links as well as explanations to create a foundation in the topics. In the Fall of 2022, I joined the the Masters in Artificial Intelligence at UTSA as a part of the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/cj-chunjiang-qian-7a7205b_welcome-thefirst-cohort-of-ms-in-ai-activity-6966397572563304448-ihyB?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop">first cohort</a>. In my masters I currently am performing research in Human Guided Reinforcement Learning as well as in Aerospace Autonomous Controls.
