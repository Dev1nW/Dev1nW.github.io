      <h2>Machine Learning Researcher</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, I’m Devin, a Machine Learning Researcher with over a year of professional research experience and a strong foundation in AI systems that blend human insights with cutting-edge technology. My expertise centers around Rating-based Reinforcement Learning, where I investigate how ratings can enhance learning and alignment in AI systems. I have also explored the emergent capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in tasks such as playing Atari games and optimizing reinforcement learning strategies for time-constrained guidance. My work has resulted in 5 publications at leading AI conferences and workshops, including AAAI, an ICML Workshop, and a AAAI Bridge, with over 10 citations to date. My technical toolkit includes Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Stable Baselines3, NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas and more.

              Presented Rating-based Reinforcement Learning (RbRL) at AAAI 2024, with 8 citations as of December 2024. Expanded the research to optimize RbRL for improved consistency across diverse environments and conditions, this work has been accepted to the Collaborative AI and Modelling of Humans Bridge Program at AAAI 2025. Investigated the use of poorly rated examples as demonstrations to avoid, resulting in another accepted paper to the Collaborative AI and Modelling of Humans Bridge Program at AAAI 2025. Additionally, I worked on benchmarking the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Atari gameplay, which was accepted to the Toward Knowledgeable Foundation Models Workshop at AAAI 2025.

            <p>
              Finalized research on Rating-based Reinforcement Learning (RbRL), demonstrating that using ratings—either from user feedback or synthetic feedback—achieved similar or superior performance compared to preference-based methods under comparable conditions. Presented this work at the Many Facets of Preference Learning workshop at ICML 2023 and the 2022 Army Research Labs Humans in Complex Systems Technical Advisory Board meeting, hosted by the National Academy of Sciences. Additionally, Deep Reinforcement Learning-based Optimal Time-constrained Intercept Guidance was accepted at the AIAA Guidance, Navigation, and Controls Conference 2024.

              Conducted research on Rating-based Reinforcement Learning (RbRL) in the DeepMind Control Suite, exploring performance changes in more complex environments. Designed and executed an IRB-approved user study with 20 participants, which revealed that providing ratings was less mentally demanding and enabled participants to offer more frequent feedback. Additionally, developed a reinforcement learning framework for optimal time-constrained intercept guidance by creating a custom Gymnasium environment with realistic physics, implementing the codebase to support RL training in this challenging scenario.
